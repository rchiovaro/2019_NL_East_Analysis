# NL East Analysis with pybaseball


`pybaseball` is a Python package for baseball data analysis. This package scrapes Baseball Reference, Baseball Savant, and FanGraphs so you don't have to. The package retrieves statcast data, pitching stats, batting stats, division standings/team records, awards data, and more. Data is available at the individual pitch level, as well as aggregated at the season level and over custom time periods. 

## Installation

Pybaseball can be installed via pip:

```python
pip install pybaseball
```



## Credit 

This project was inspired by James LeDoux's analysis of the 2018 NL Central.

The Lahman data comes from [Sean Lahman's baseball database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/).

All other data comes from FanGraphs, Baseball Reference, and Baseball Savant.
